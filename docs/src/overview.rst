Overview
=========

This repository provides a test harness to help AI Engine developers easily build and test their application on VCK190. With minor modifications and a few minutes to build, developers can turn their AIE simulation project into SD card image for hardware run. The test harness consists of three major components: 
 

* Test harness on PL, including 16 output channels to send data to AI Engine and 16 input channels, to load data from AI Engine. We provided a pre-built implementation of test harness (A .xsa file which needs to be downloaded from Xilinx) to save the trouble to build. 
 
* A set of software APIs to initialize device, setup configs to drive test harness channels and run tests. 

* Scripts to help package developer's application on AI Engine (libadf.a) and test application on PS with pre-built test harness and generate the boot image for hardware run.
