Installation
============

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

To use the test harness, up-to-date installations of the following softwares and libraries are required:

- Vitis tools (https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis.html)

- Xilinx Runtime (https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/xrt.html#gettingstarted)

- Versal common image for Vitis embedded platforms (https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html)


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Clone test harness repository::

    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/AI-Engine-Test-Harness.git

2. Download the prebuilt test harness XSAs and prebuilt SD card images::

    cd AI-Engine-Test-Harness/
    source setup.sh

3. Flash the SD card image to an SD card

4. Boot the VCK190 or VEK280 board with the SD card

5. Run the test harness server on the board by following the instructions::

    cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1
    ./run_server.sh

.. CAUTION::
   The prebuilt XSAs can only be used with the 2024.2 version of the Vitis tool. 
   To build and test your AI Engine graph using other versions of Vitis, you must first rebuild the XSA with the corresponding version of the Vitis tool, as described in the section below.

Rebuilding from Source
----------------------

The prebuilt test harness XSA can optionally be rebuilt from source as follows::

   cd AI-Engine-Test-Harness/test_harness
   source <path to Vitis installation>/settings64.sh
   make clean
   # To build functional/performance testing mode XSA for VCK190
   make xsa TARGET=hw DEVICE=vck190
   # Or to build functional/performance testing mode XSA for VEK280
   make xsa TARGET=hw DEVICE=vek280
   # To build the sd card image for VCK190
   make sd_card TARGET=hw DEVICE=vck190
    # Or to build the sd card image for VEK280
   make sd_card TARGET=hw DEVICE=vek280
